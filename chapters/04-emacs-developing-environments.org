* Emacs for developers - Emacs developing environments

Emacs, thanks to major and minor modes, can be transformed into a powerful specific development environment.

According to the kind of files you are editing (or a command you type), it can change and give you specific features that fit the need of a programming language (or a task like debugging, launching unit tests, ...)

** Emacs for Ruby developers

There are many Ruby developers who describe their setup around the web. Here are the most popular:

** Emacs for C/C++/Objective-C

C languages are very well handled by Emacs and it allows you to edit, debug and run programs with Emacs very easily, with all the control you want.

- If you develop in Go, you really should refer to the great [[http://yousefourabi.com/blog/2014/05/emacs-for-go/][Emacs for Go]] article, written by Yousef Ourabi.

PHP, along with all the web technologies (HTML/JS/CSS) are very well supported in Emacs. The PHP mode does almost all the work by itself.
